It's not too late for 2016 review posts is it? Well, too bad. I wanted to recount some of the fun video games I played in 2016. I don't think I qualify as an avid gamer, but I do enjoy them from time to time. I tend to finish what I start even if pains me, but I'm far from a 100% completionist. I'm happy beating a game, but I usually don't need to explore every piece of minutia.

I tend to lean toward indie games with some exceptions. I also tend to lean against first person shooters and massively multiplayers games, again with exceptions. I like puzzlers and side scrollers and rpgs and local multiplayer games. I like all sorts of stuff!

Anyways, in roughly the order I played them:

Ori and the Blind Forest
Steam on PC
Ok, I played this towards the end of 2015, but it's such a beautiful game that I wanted to include it. 


Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth
Steam on PC
I love Binding of Isaac. It's like the dungeon levels in Zelda, but more difficult. There are an absurd number of items (I always keep the [http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/The_Binding_of_Isaac:_Afterbirth](Wikia page) open when I play), and the levels and bosses are randomized so it's always a new game. There's lots of secrets and easter eggs which I haven't fully explored. This is the most recent version which is a smoother game, fewer bugs, and a ton of tiems. I think there's also some modding capabilities to be done more easily which seems fun but isn't really my thing. This doesn't require a huge investment of time; you can play for 20 or 30 minutes every once in awhile since it's fresh each time.

My only gripe is that occasionally you equip an item that you'd rather not have, and you can't get rid of it. Since there's so many items, it's hard to remember what they all do.


The Witness
Steam on PC
An open world puzzler by Jonathan Blow, creator of Braid (which is also excellent). You're basically stuck on a picturesque island full of hundreds of grid-like puzzles where you have to trace the correct path to complete them. It's amazing how much puzzle variety you can get with these grids. There's several different types of these puzzles and they all have a soft-ish introduction so you can learn what the various symbols mean. I'm proud to say I solved over 500 puzzles and beat the game without any online assistance, but it was tempting. There were definitely a few I sketched out, or just had to leave the game awhile and come back. There's a few puzzles that were incredibly tough that I did not solve, but weren't crucial to beating the game. At that point I was getting a bit tired of the game. There's more to the world than this, but I don't want to write any spoilers.




Grand Theft Auto
Steam on PC
I think everyone knows roughly how this game works. Massive world, incredible freedoms, driving, shooting, etc This is the first time I've owned a GTA game, and while the freedoms are fun, I was drawn more to the compelling storyline. The dialog is great including some pretty funny gems. The organized capers and shootouts are really fun and genuinely challenging (I'm also bad at first person shooters). There are also some fun side quests like Trevor's rampages, Franklin's races, and assassination jobs. 

Since it was my first GTA game, occasionally, I found myself unsure of how to proceed through the storyline. I didn't realize until late that you can easily replay your successful missions without jeopardizing your current progress. Maybe I would've tried to get some of the various mission achievements. Oh well. It felt like having experience with prior GTA games was helpful for some of these idiosyncracies. There are a few minigames that are really boring, like yoga. Tennis is pretty easy to win. I didn't try any of the online multiplayer, but I probably should.

Rocket League
Played on both XBox and PS4
Trucks. That can fly. Playing Soccer. That's it. That's the game! Local multiplayer with some friends against some online foes is a blast even if you're terrible which, when you first start almost certainly are. It's a game that's fun when you're bad, and remains fun even as your improve. Every once in awhile you'll do something accidentally spectacular that's hard to explain.

A few negatives: There's definitely a bit of a learning curve which can be frustrating for some people. Sometimes you get stuck on the wall or ceiling which gets frustrating. Trying to do local multiplayer against online opponents is a pain in the ass on Playstation. Each player is required to have an online playstation account in order to participate. XBox, on the other hand makes it easy. The primary player needs an account, and the others can play as guests on his account.
