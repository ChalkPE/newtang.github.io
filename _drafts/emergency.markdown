I dedicated some time into creating an Emergency Supply Kit. It might be a little paranoid, but as a Northern California resident, the possibility of a large earthquake looms. Admittedly, the current administration also makes me worry about other kinds of catastrophes, but I digress. 

Interestingly, the sources I have listed below don't delve too much into what exactly the goal of the kit is. Details like this aid in knowing what supplies to get. From what I gather I think the goals revolve around surviving comfortably for 3 days without access to running water, electricity, or convenient food. More specifically, for this the goals are:
- stay nourished
- stay warm
- stay hydrated
- stay sheltered
- stay hygenic
- stay sane
- stay safe
- stay reasonably comfortable
- stay informed if possible
- be able to address basic medical situations
- have access some handy tools
- keep it in one place so my family can quickly grab it all if we have to evacuate.

In summary, try to maintain the base of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) for a few days without all of our modern conveniences.

After consulting a few different sources, my whole kit is about 37 compact items plus food. Not surprisingly, most of it is basically camping supplies, and several items we already had. I didn't go for absolute minimalism. For instance, I could live without a fork and knife, but a couple pairs of utensils don't add much bulk. Here's my list.

For water storage, the recommendation I saw was 1 gallon per person per day. So for me and my wife that's 6 gallons. We added a 7th gallon for our rabbits.

 We also purchased food that was palatable and would expire in about two years if possible.
- canned chili
- canned tuna
- canned stew
- canned fruit
- mixed nuts
- peanut butter
- pringles
- Yoohoo

(I'm not exactly following [my diet here](/posts/losing-weight-by-giving-up-carbohydrates).) I have some calender reminders set to remind me to eat or donate the food before it expires.

I was never a boy scout, and I'm not much of a camper or a survivalist, but I think I have a reasonable kit.
