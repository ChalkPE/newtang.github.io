I finally got around to dedicating time into creating an Emergency Supply Kit. It might be a little paranoid, but as a Northern California resident, the possibility of a large earthquake looms. Admittedly, the current administration also makes me worry about other kinds of catastrophes, but I digress. 


- comfortably survive 3 days without water, electricity, or convenient access to food.
- keep it in one place so my wife and I can grab it all and go if we have to evacuate.

The whole kit is about 37 relatively compact items plus food. Not surprisingly, most of it is basically camping supplies, and several items we already had. Here's my list.

AA batteries
bag or container to keep supplies in

camping whistle
cash
copy of id

duct tape
dust mask
eating utensils
extra clothes
first aid kit
flashlight
garbage bags
hand sanitizer
matches in waterproof container
mess kit
moist towelettes
notebook
old pair of glasses
pack of cards
painkillers
paper towels
pencils/pens
plastic sheeting
rabbit food (We have two rabbits)
soap
sleeping bag
swiss army knife
feminine supplies and personal hygiene items
thermal blankets
toilet paper
towel
water (1 gallon per person per day = 6 gallons + 1 gallon for rabbits = 7 gallons)
[water purification tablets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GG19KWQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
wool blanket
work gloves
zip ties

We also purchased a bunch of canned food. Namely:
- tuna
- beef stew
- canned fruit
- mixed nuts
 We were looking for food that was palatable and expires in about two years. I have some calender reminders set before the food expires to either eat or donate it, and of course to replenish it.
