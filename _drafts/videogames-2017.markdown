Obduction
I really, really wanted to like Obduction. It's made by the creators of Myst which I had played a long time ago as a teenager. It's beautiful, it's haunting, and, well, it's a bit slow, and I just couldn't get into it. I don't know if it's because I don't have the patience to gut through some of the slower or confusing parts. Maybe I was just excited to try my hand at other games that were on the horizon. But, for whatever reason I just wasn't captivated by this game. Maybe, I'll try to revisit it someday.

Armikrog
This is a quick, fun whimisical game. I love the usage of stop motion. Puzzles aren't particularly challenging, except maybe one or two. Game isn't very long. But it's fun.
