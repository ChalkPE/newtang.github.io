Get Bit
Simple game with a simple mechanic. The goal is for your character to not get eaten by a shark. This can be played in about 15 minutes which is a nice way to kill some time. I wouldn't revolve a boardgame night around this.

Joking Hazard
Basically a visual version of Cards Against Humanity where you're trying to build a comic strip. Very NSFW, but fun for casual, large groups.

Power Grid
Like Ticket To Ride but more complicated. Requires powering a grid of cities using different kinds of power plants. Power plants have different capacities at different prices which require different resources.

Pandemic Legacy
- hard to organize with 4 people consistently
- lots of nuance and exceptions to rules as you progress.

Dixit
I've played this before, but I figured I would document it here. Each person has a few cards with wild, vibrant, unusual artwork on them. Each person rotates taking a turn as the storyteller. The storyteller chooses a card from their hand and comes up with a short story (can be a word or phrase) that describes it. The other players choose a card that would work for the same story. The storyteller is trying to getting some, but not all of the players to guess his card. If all, or none of the players guess his card, the storyteller is penalized. Fun for small groups.

Tokaido
- The object of the game is to (hilariously) have a better Japanese vacation than your peers which is a hilarious premise, but a solid game. There are several strategies you can take. Once you get the hang of the game, it's pretty quick. About 45 minutes. Also, the artwork and design is superb.
