Get Bit
Simple game with a simple mechanic. The goal is for your character to not get eaten by a shark. This can be played in about 15 minutes which is a nice way to kill some time. I wouldn't revolve a boardgame night around this.

Joking Hazard
Power Grid
Like Ticket To Ride but more complicated.

Pandemic Legacy
- hard to organize with 4 people consistently
- lots of nuance and exceptions to rules as you progress.
