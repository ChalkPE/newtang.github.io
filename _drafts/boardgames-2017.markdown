Get Bit
Simple game with a simple mechanic. The goal is for your character to not get eaten by a shark. This can be played in about 15 minutes which is a nice way to kill some time. I wouldn't revolve a boardgame night around this.

Joking Hazard
Basically a visual version of Cards Against Humanity where you're trying to build a comic strip. Very NSFW, but fun for casual, large groups.

Power Grid
Like Ticket To Ride but more complicated.

Pandemic Legacy
- hard to organize with 4 people consistently
- lots of nuance and exceptions to rules as you progress.

Tokaido
- The object of the game is to (hilariously) have a better Japanese vacation than your peers which is a hilarious premise, but a solid game. There are several strategies you can take. Once you get the hang of the game, it's pretty quick. About 45 minutes. Also, the artwork and design is superb.
