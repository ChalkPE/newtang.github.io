The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu
  - starts a little slow
  - very creative ideas
  - doesn't go in a direction I expected

Without Their Permission by Alexis Ohanian
 - fun read, but not a ton of actionable learning items in it.
 - but it's inspiring to get to work and build something.

Delivering Happiness by Tony Hsieh
 - Pretty interesting story about Hsieh's life and decision making
 - Really enjoyed the discussion about how company culture is an extension of brand
 - I still can't believe he walked away from $40 million. He just had to continue working at LinkExchange for a year and he couldn't do it! 
 - Very end touches upon the science of happiness. This correlated well with Drive which talked about purpose, autonomy, and mastery. Delivering Happiness added Connectedness which I really like.

Scalable Internet Architectures by Theo Schlossnagle
- I didn't like this very much. It bounced between topics I knew a lot about like source control, to others that weren't very well explained. Maybe it was too dry, or it just didn't interest me. I don't know, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury

Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
 - As an experienced developer, I agreed with quite a lot in the book. It was still worthwhile to read; it crystalized some comments, made me reflect on some of my programming values, and nicely explained several topics. I think I would've gained more by reading this five years ago, but it was still worthwhile. I would recommend it to people who've programmed a few years and are looking to make the next jump.
