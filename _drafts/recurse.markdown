In the latter half of 2016 I knew I was going to have some free time on my hands, and I wanted to spend some of that time improving as a programmer. After being admitted, I decided to attend the Recurse Center, a sort of self-guided retreat for programmers located in SoHo in Manhattan. 

### Application
The application process is pretty straightforward. There's an online form I filled out which includes writing fizzbuzz. I've been told that a surprising number of applicants don't write a functioning fizzbuzz. The next step is a Skype interview where I  chatted about programming, and what I hoped to get out of Recurse. It was more of a personality interview. Then I had another Skype pair-programming interview. Beforhand, I had to prepare a basic project (you're given a few choices) ahead of time and submit it. Then I paired on it with the interviewer, going over different parts of it. Then I was accepted! Typically, batches are 12 weeks long, which is a pretty long time. Nearly a quarter of a year. I elected to do a half-batch at six weeks starting in November of 2016. There was a break for Thanksgiving and it ended around the 14th of December.

### The people
There were about 60 people from all walks of life who attended Recurse while I was there. The batches overlap, so half the people were new, and half had already been there for six weeks. There were some with years of programming experience like me. Others were only a couple years out of school and wanted to see if software was for them instead of their chosen major. Some were exploring career changes. Generally it skewed younger, but as a 33-year old I didn't feel out of place. Since it requires a lot of time off, everyone was in a sort of life crossroads. Also, the program really tries to filter for friendly, decent human beings.

### The environment
The Recurse Center looks like a typical startup office. There's a big open space with desks in different configurations, a small kitchen, bathrooms, a few conference rooms, and a small area reserved for Recurse's handful of employees. There's a space for larger gatherings, and they have all the various wires, connectors, adapters and plugs you need. Even though it's an open floor plan, it's kept pretty quiet. Groups typically huddle in a conference room or chat quietly to the side. I found it to be very conducive to productivity. There are also a few social rules they ask everyone to follow, most notably, no feigning suprise. Basically avoid this:

> Person A: You should use ExpressJS for this.<br/>
> Person B: What's Express?<br/>
> Person A: You don't know what express is!?

When there's a group people with a wide variety of programming expertise, of course people aren't going to know everything. Even the more experienced among us have gaps in our knowledge. So, personally, I love this rule. It makes everyone more comfortable asking questions which is obviously perfect for a learning environment. I hope to carry this with me.


### Location
In SoHo there are several nearby coffee shops, restaurants, and food carts. The lamb over vegetables at the Halal cart at the corner of Houston and Broadway was simply the best. Ask for the green sauce.

### Costs
Recurse is free to attend. The only thing they ask is that if you're looking for a job after RC, that you go through their on site recruiting team first. That's it. They have lots of connections in NY and SF and a few here and there. Additionally, you have to find a place to stay and New York is pricy. I stayed in an Airbnb in Brooklyn, near the Prospect Park Q-train stop. Conveniently, it was about a 30 minute train ride.  I probably jumped the gun and paid a little too much. If I was more patient, I might have been able to share a room with a Recurser who was alreayd there.
