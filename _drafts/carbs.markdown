Last August, a routine physical left me in a bit of a shock as I learned that I had gained 20lbs since college, roughly 40% of which in the last year. I had an exercise routine, I walked a lot, and I didn't think I ate that badly.  I didn't think I felt or looked noticably fatter, but, the data doesn't lie and this was not the "up-and-to-the-right" graph that I like. It was time for a change, and at the time several of my coworkers were espousing the virtues of a keto diet, one that significantly reduces carbohydrate intake, and replaces it with fats and protein.

The overly simplified premise is routed in basic biochemistry, a field I know nothing about, but carbohydrates spike secretion of the hormone, insulin, and insulin is responsible for fat storage. By eliminating the carbohydrates, there is no additional fat storage. Without carbs, the body goes into a state of ketosis where it uses ketones for fuel. Ketones are derived from fat, namely fat stores. This causes weight loss and a variety of metabolic improvements. It turns out, carbohydrates are completely unnecessary for life. 

The TL;DR: I lost 15lbs in 2 months by giving up carbohydrates. Then 5lbs more in the months that followed.

A couple days in is when I experience the "keto flu", the uncomfortable transition of entering ketosis. For about a day I had a headache and felt lethargic, but that's it. It didn't see any weight improvements after a week, but after two, the improvements were noticable on the scale I had just purchased.

I've heard people who claim that this diet gave them more energy, they felt sharper etc. Physiologically, the only change I noticed was that I would wake up quicker and be less bleary-eyed.

It should didn't exercise extra. I didn't starve myself, or count calories. I just gave up carbohydrates. Specifically, I limited myself to a measly 25g of net carbohydrates a day. Net-carbs = total carbs - fiber. I didn't keep a running carb total, but I used that as a basis for how many carbs I could consume in a meal. For example, if a salad dressing had carbs, I could measure the amount so I had 8g worth (1/3ish of 25g) of net-carbohydrates. 

What I didn't eat:
bread, pasta, rice, quinoa, waffles, pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, most fruit (yes fruit, I'll get to that), desserts of any kind, sugar, honey, syrup, potatos, beer, sweetened drinks

Here's a sampling of some of my meals.
Breakfast: Full fat Fage greek yogurt, with some berries. Eggs, bacon, sausage. Avocado-frozen-berry-greek yogurt smoothie.

Lunch/Dinner: 
Spinach, cheddar omelette. 
Lamb over vegetables.
Replaced pasta meals with spaghetti squash (ie sausage, onion, kale over spaghetti squash)
Garden salad with egg and/or chicken.
Burger without the bun, usually in a lettuce wrap, or over a salad.
Burrito bowl (no tortilla and no rice).
Chicken or fish and broccoli 

Snacks:
String cheese, protein bars (Nature Valley Protein were a good mix of low carb, and low price), almonds, jerky

Drinks:
Water, coffee, tea, wine, hard liquors.

As you see, there's not much fruit here. Berries are high in fiber so their net-carbs are low. I had an apple or orange once in awhile. Bananas, mangos, melons are entirely sugar and were avoided. Most the micronutrients are obtained through vegetables.

As you can see it's a lot more meats and vegetables, which is unfortunately more expensive. I also consumed more meat than usual. You can do this diet as a vegetarian or vegan, but it's harder.

So, I lost 20lbs overall, my triglycerides were down, and my LDL cholesterol was down slightly (studies suggest this might not be as important as HDL/trigliceride ratio). 

Now that my weight is back to healthier levels, I'm reintroducing carbs but making a few crucial changes. I really don't really want to live my life without enjoying a cookie or a beer every once in awhile. So, here's my changes:

 * I'm going to continue weighing myself weekly and jotting it in my spreadsheet. This will keep me from going astray to far.
 * Continue eating a low carb breakfast. It's easy, it's delicious. 
 * Avoid most desserts. If I have a dessert, don't eat another one for awhile. 
 * Avoid sugary drinks. I think easy access to free sweet drinks and desserts at Yahoo was my undoing.

This is a diet that makes sense to me. Meals comprising of strong meat and vegetable components strike me as how omnivores were meant to eat. It feels like we're in the early stages of a long overdue dietary course correction. Although discontinued, it's laughable how wrong the food pyramid appears to be. If I were to hazard a guess, I would guess there is probably a continuum of how bad carbohydrates are, with quinoa and rice being less bad than sugar or high fructose corn syrup, but I think more research has to be done. We've been told to reduce fat, but how many of us have known someone who gave up pop, and lost weight? There's no fat in pop. Sure, I could calorie restrict myself, but being ravenously hungry is not sustainable.

Obviously, I'm not a doctor. I don't know how this diet works with medications etc. Please don't undertake this because some guy on the internet said it was great. But, I would urge you to read some of the literature, and see if it's right for you.
